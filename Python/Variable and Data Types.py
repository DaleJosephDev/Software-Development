# TRY IT YOURSELF
# Write a separate program to accomplish each of these exercises. 
# Save each program with a file name that follows standard Python 
# conventions, using lower case letters and underscores, 
# such as simple_message.py and simple _messages.py.

# 2-1. Simple Message: Assign a message to a variable, and then print that message.

# 2-2. Simple Messages: Assign a message to a variable, and print that message.

# Then change the value of the variable to a new message, and print the new message.

print(simple_messages)
